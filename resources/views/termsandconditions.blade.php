        <p>All bookings are held in good faith for the arrival to the departure dates listed in the reservation system, at the rate specified at the time of booking.

Reservations may be cancelled if any of the above conditions cannot be met and verified. Any reservation made is not confirmed or held until replied with a Letter of Confirmation or a Voucher thru email by the Resort Reservations. Once a booking is confirmed and the guest does not occupy the room on the due date, the advance payment would be forfeited. Confirmed bookings may be rescheduled at your request by email, subject to availability, except for Peak season at the rate of USD75 per villa. This doesn’t mean that advance payment would be offset for another guest for the same date(s).</p>
